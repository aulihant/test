# test

1. Test out new repo connection with PM Sandbox Project in Jira with "PM-17" commit message, commit directly to main (RESULT: put PM-17 in "In Progress" state)
2. Repeat of #1 without mention of "PM-11" because pressed wrong button (RESULT: PM-17 stayed in "In Progress" and still showing just 1 commit)
3. Test out new repo connection with PM Sandbox Project with a new branch and "PM-17" in the PR and nowhere else
